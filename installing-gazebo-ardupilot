The plugin we will be using works with gazebo versions 7 to 9. 
We recommend gazebo9 as the new development will append on this version. 
It isnâ€™t available for older versions of Ubuntu though, 
so you may need to use an earlier version depending on your system.

sudo apt install gazebo9 libgazebo9-dev

check the installation by launching Gazebo.

gazebo --verbose

Plugin installation
We will be using khancyr plugin for the following exaplation. 
First clone it somewhere in your home directory.

git clone https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo
cd ardupilot_gazebo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4

Modify the -j flag according to your processor. 
If you do not know the number of cores in your processor, 
you can find it by typing nproc.

sudo make install

echo 'source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh' >> ~/.bashrc

echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/models' >> ~/.bashrc

. ~/.bashrc
