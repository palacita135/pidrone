Install Raspbian OS
sudo fdisk -l
#if you're using a terminal over SSH, you'll have to run:
umount /dev/sda1
#Depending on the drive, you may need to also run umount /dev/sda2, umount /dev/sda3, and so on, depending on how many partitions are on the drive from previous usage.
#Then, to erase and format your flash drive for Linux usage, run:
sudo parted /dev/sda

mklabel gpt

#If prompted to erase the drive, type y and press Enter. Then run:

mkpart
MyExternalDrive
ext4
0%
100%
quit

#Next, we'll need to format that partition. If your drive is located at /dev/sda, the new partition will be located at /dev/sda1 (if the drive is /dev/sdb, you'll use /dev/sdb1, and so on):

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

#Press y and Enter when asked if you want to proceed. Then run:

sudo e2label /dev/sda1 MyExternalDrive

sudo shutdown -r now

sudo chown -R pi /media/pi/MyExternalDrive

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install samba samba-common

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
[MyMedia]
path = /media/pi/MyExternalDrive/
writeable = yes
create mask = 0775
directory mask = 0775
public=no

Ctrl+X Yes Enter

sudo smbpasswd -a pi
sudo systemctl restart smbd

Access Your Media
And everything should be ready to rock. Head to your Windows PC, open a File Explorer window
and type \\raspberrypi\MyMedia in the address bar (replacing MyMedia with whatever your share is called).
If you press Enter, you should be able to enter your Samba username (pi) and password and see your shared drive.
If you run into trouble, you might have to use the Pi's IP address, like \\192.168.1.10\MyMedia instead.

To connect on a Mac, open Finder and click Go > Connect to Server, typing in smb://raspberrypi when prompted.
